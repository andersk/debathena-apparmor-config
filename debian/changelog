debathena-apparmor-config (1.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * ensure local/usr.sbin/cupsd and local/usr.sbin.ntpd files exist even
    if those packages aren't installed (Trac: #737)

debathena-apparmor-config (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Transform <abstractions/nameservice> to allow reading
    /etc/nsswitch.conf.debathena and /etc/hesiod.conf.debathena. (Trac:
    #610)
  * Pseudo-transform /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.ntpd to allow reading
    /etc/ntp.conf.debathena. (Trac: #611)
  * Fix the <abstractions/X> patch to get the right Xauthority path
    (/var/run/athena-sessions/xauth-*)
  * In <tunables/home.d/debathena>, only whitelist canonical paths, not
    symlinked ones, because AppArmor resolves symlinks.

debathena-apparmor-config (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Break old versions of kerberos-config to try and force the correct
    upgrade order.
  * Change permissions on lpr in <abstractions/cups-client> to make
    AppArmor whine less, and possibly even be more secure.
  * Cleanup /etc/apparmor.d/tunables/home diversion when we upgrade to a
    release that has <tunables/home.d> (i.e. Lucid)

debathena-apparmor-config (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Greg Brockman ]
  * Initial release.

  [ Evan Broder ]
  * Only restart apparmor if it was previously running. (Trac: #506)
  * Reload apparmor in the prerm instead of the postrm, since that's where
    the diversions are removed
  * Run debhelper- and config-package-dev-generated postinst/prerm code
    before reloading apparmor, so the diversions are actually in place
    when we do.
  * Include AFS homedirs in the list of home directories. (Trac: #601)
  * Allow X applications to read /var/run/xauth-*. (Trac: #602)
  * Bump Debian standards version and debhelper compatibility level.
