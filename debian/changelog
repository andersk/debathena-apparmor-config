debathena-apparmor-config (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Greg Brockman ]
  * Initial release.

  [ Evan Broder ]
  * Only restart apparmor if it was previously running. (Trac: #506)
  * Reload apparmor in the prerm instead of the postrm, since that's where
    the diversions are removed
  * Run debhelper- and config-package-dev-generated postinst/prerm code
    before reloading apparmor, so the diversions are actually in place
    when we do.
  * Include AFS homedirs in the list of home directories. (Trac: #601)
  * Allow X applications to read /var/run/xauth-*. (Trac: #602)
  * Bump Debian standards version and debhelper compatibility level.
